### How to use the built-in Widget Slider and the Static Hero?

The Frontpage Slider is Widget driven. Simply add more than one Widget
to widget position "*Hero Slider*".

-   Click on Appearance -&gt; Widgets
-   Add two or more widgets of any kind to widget area "Hero Slider"
-   Thats all, folks..

If you just want a static Hero header or want a second below the Hero
Slider, you should add a Widget to the "*Static Hero*" Widget.
